# PRD: Verifiable Background Check System for Non-Profit Volunteers

## Overview
The **Verifiable Background Check System for Non-Profit Volunteers** is a blockchain-based solution designed to streamline and secure the background verification process for individuals volunteering at non-profit organizations. It ensures:
- Transparent, tamper-proof background check records.
- Volunteer privacy and data minimization through selective disclosure.
- Trusted verification via authorized evaluators.
- Easy access for non-profits to confirm volunteer credentials.

Each smart contract is modular, handling a single responsibility, ensuring flexibility and security.

## Objectives
1. Provide a verifiable, immutable record of volunteer background checks.
2. Allow non-profits to validate volunteer credentials without storing sensitive personal data on-chain.
3. Empower accredited background check providers to issue verified attestations.
4. Incentivize compliance and accountability through tokenised reputation.
5. Enable volunteers to reuse their background check credentials across multiple organizations.

---

## Stakeholders
- **Volunteers**: Individuals applying to work at non-profits.
- **Non-Profit Organizations**: Entities requiring verified background information on volunteers.
- **Accredited Check Providers**: Authorized agencies conducting background checks.
- **Auditors/Regulators**: Oversight bodies ensuring process compliance.
- **Community DAO**: Governance mechanism overseeing trusted providers and dispute resolution.

## Core Modules (Smart Contracts)

### 1. **VolunteerRegistry Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Register volunteers on-chain with minimal metadata (unique ID, hash of personal data, not raw data).

**Data Structures:**  
- `map volunteers { volunteerId: { hashedIdentity: string, registered: bool, metadata: string } }`
- `event VolunteerRegistered(volunteerId, hashedIdentity)`

**Justification:**  
Establishes a tamper-proof identity anchor for volunteers without exposing sensitive data.

---

### 2. **ProviderRegistry Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Maintain a whitelist of accredited background check providers authorized to issue verifications.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map providers { providerId: { name: string, verified: bool, metadata: string } }`
- `event ProviderApproved(providerId, name)`

**Justification:**  
Ensures only trusted, verified agencies can issue background check attestations, preventing fraudulent claims.

---

### 3. **BackgroundCheckAttestation Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Allow accredited providers to publish cryptographic attestations of completed checks for volunteers.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map attestations { attestationId: { volunteerId: uint, providerId: uint, checkType: string, status: string, issuedAt: uint, validUntil: uint } }`
- `event AttestationIssued(attestationId, volunteerId, providerId, checkType, status)`

**Justification:**  
Provides immutable, time-bound verification records while keeping sensitive details off-chain.

---

### 4. **VerificationAccess Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Enable volunteers to grant non-profits access to specific background check attestations.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map accessGrants { grantId: { volunteerId: uint, orgId: uint, attestationId: uint, expiry: uint, active: bool } }`
- `event AccessGranted(volunteerId, orgId, attestationId)`

**Justification:**  
Empowers volunteers to control who can view their records, supporting selective disclosure and privacy.

---

### 5. **GovernanceDAO Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Community-led governance over provider accreditation, dispute resolution, and system upgrades.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map proposals { proposalId: { title: string, description: string, votesFor: uint, votesAgainst: uint, deadline: uint, executed: bool } }`
- `map votes { proposalId: { voter: principal, choice: bool } }`
- `event ProposalCreated(proposalId, title)`
- `event VoteCast(proposalId, voter, choice)`

**Justification:**  
DAO governance ensures transparent community oversight, reducing reliance on a central authority.

---

### 6. **ReputationNFT Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Mint non-transferable NFTs (soulbound tokens) to volunteers representing verified background check completion.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map reputationNFTs { volunteerId: uint, metadata: string, issuedBy: uint }`
- `event ReputationNFTIssued(volunteerId, metadata)`

**Justification:**  
Provides a portable, verifiable credential for volunteers, usable across non-profits without repeated checks.

---

## System Workflow

1. **Volunteer Registration**  
   Volunteer signs up and is recorded in `VolunteerRegistry`.
2. **Provider Accreditation**  
   Verified providers are onboarded via `ProviderRegistry`.
3. **Background Check Attestation**  
   Provider issues check records via `BackgroundCheckAttestation`.
4. **Volunteer Grants Access**  
   Volunteer shares attestations with non-profits using `VerificationAccess`.
5. **Non-Profit Validation**  
   Non-profits verify attestation authenticity on-chain.
6. **Recognition**  
   Volunteer receives `ReputationNFT` for completed verification.
7. **Governance Oversight**  
   DAO manages disputes and approves/removes providers.

---

## Technical Requirements
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Clarity contracts), leveraging Bitcoin finality.
- **Standards**: SIP-009 for NFTs, SIP-010 for fungible tokens (if DAO incentives are introduced).
- **Privacy Preserving**: Store only hashes/commitments of volunteer data on-chain.
- **Wallet Integration**: Hiro Wallet for volunteer/non-profit interaction.
- **Event Logging**: All actions are logged for transparency.

---

## Justification for Modular Design
- **VolunteerRegistry** ensures identity anchors without exposing PII.  
- **ProviderRegistry** enforces trust boundaries.  
- **BackgroundCheckAttestation** ensures transparency and immutability.  
- **VerificationAccess** grants selective, time-bound data sharing.  
- **GovernanceDAO** decentralizes oversight.  
- **ReputationNFT** provides recognition and reusability of verified checks.  

---

## Success Metrics
- Number of volunteers registered.
- Number of accredited providers onboarded.
- Total attestations issued and verified.
- Non-profits actively validating records.
- NFTs issued as credentials.
- Governance proposals and participation rate.
